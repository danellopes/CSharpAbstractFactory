### Example of the Abstract Factory

This example of the faceted builder design pattern was develop using C# language.

This method provides us with the capacity to enhance system flexibility by constructing factories that yield interfaces, not concrete classes. In the event that our factory must return a different concrete factory, we simply construct a new concrete class that implements the factory interface. This is accomplished by injecting it using the designated method, ensuring seamless operation.
